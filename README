OVERVIEW
========

This project is designed to accomplish the following goals:

1) Monitor a port that is connected to a switch. Wait until the switch is
   pressed.
2) Once pressed, the routine should keep track of how long the switch is held
   down.
3) Wait for approximately one second.
4) Using another port connected to a LED, turn on the LED for the same amount
   of time that the switch was pressed earlier.
